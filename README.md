# UbervsLyft
I aim to gain insights into the cab industry in Boston, including the demand for these services, the effectiveness of pricing strategies, and the impact of external factors such as weather on ride usage. The findings of this analysis can be used to inform business decisions for both Uber and Lyft, as well as provide useful information.
